## Knowledge Distillation for Storytelling Models

### Overview
Knowledge distillation is a technique used to transfer knowledge from a large, complex model to a smaller, more efficient one. In this project, we aim to distill storytelling knowledge from the larger language model, Llama 2-70B, to the smaller model, Phi 1-1B. This process will help us create a robust, efficient storytelling model that can generate high-quality narratives without the computational overhead of its larger counterpart.

### Strategy
The distillation process is broken down into two primary steps, focusing on generating and refining story content:

#### Step 1: Generating Story Topics
First, we provide the larger model, Llama 2-70B, with various story themes selected from the top 200 common literature themes listed by ProWritingAid, carefully filtering out any themes that involve explicit or restricted content. The model uses these themes to create concise story topics or summaries.

##### Prompt Engineering for Story Topics
We employ a specific prompting technique known as "1-shot learning" to guide the model in generating story summaries. This technique involves providing the model with a single example of the desired task, setting the context for its responses. Hereâ€™s how the prompt is structured:

```python
def create_topics_prompt(theme: str) -> str:
    """
    Generates a structured prompt for creating story topics based on a given theme.

    Args:
        theme (str): The specific theme for story creation.

    Returns:
        str: A fully formatted prompt for generating multiple story topics.
    """

    prompt = f'''
    [INST]:<<SYS>>You are a chatbot that provides story topics for users.
    
    For example:
    <User>: Please give me a summary of a story.
    
    Response:
    
    1. An ugly dragon seeking the crystal of the forest.
    2. A fairy with a desire to feast on carnivorous plants.
    3. A space mermaid carrying a fan.
    4. A mummy harboring dreams of becoming a Hollywood star.
    5. A samurai who fell in love with a fish.
    
    Now it's your turn. Please respond in English in a creative and innovative manner. The more unique and different, the better.
    Your answer must be in topics like above. Do not give titles for your stories!<<SYS>>
    
    <<User>>: Invent a completely new story summary about "{theme}". Provide 7 possibilities. [/INST]
    '''

    return prompt

```


The model will use these themes to create concise story topics or summaries that encapsulate potential narratives. For example, given the theme "Abuse of power," the model might generate a topic like:

```python
"The Last Days of the Solar Empire: A tale of a dying empire ruled by a mad emperor who uses his power to build a pyramid of skulls."
```

These topics serve as a distilled essence of potential stories, providing a thematic and narrative foundation without detailing the full story.

#### Step 2: Expanding into Full Stories

After generating story topics in Step 1, we utilize these prompts to guide the smaller model, Phi 1-1B, in crafting detailed, narrative-driven stories. This structured approach allows Phi 1-1B to concentrate on narrative development, enriching the plot and characters without the initial burden of theme conceptualization.

##### Prompt Engineering for Stories

To aid the smaller model in creating compelling narratives, we use a prompt engineering technique that specifies the desired structure and brevity of the stories. Here's the function used to generate these prompts:

```python
def create_story_prompt(topic: str) -> str:
    """
    Constructs a prompt for generating a short story focused on a specific topic, ensuring the story is concise yet complete.

    Args:
        topic (str): The central theme of the story to be created.

    Returns:
        str: A formatted prompt instructing the model to produce a short story with two compact paragraphs, including a resolution and character development.
    """
    # Define the prompt with specific instructions for story creation
    prompt = f'''
    [INST]:<<SYS>>You are a chatbot tasked with creating stories for users.
    
    Your stories must be short, they CANNOT be long, which means your stories must have only TWO paragraphs of small size.
    Ensure each story has a clear conclusion and well-defined characters!<<SYS>>
    
    <<User>>: Invent a completely new story about "{topic}".[/INST]
    '''
    return prompt
```


For instance, the topic about the Solar Empire would be expanded into a detailed story, illustrating the decline of the empire and the emperor's tyranny as follows:

```python
"In the final days of the Solar Empire, a mad emperor ruled with an iron fist. His power was unmatched, and his people lived in fear of his wrath. The emperor was obsessed with the idea of building a pyramid of skulls, a monument to his own greatness. He believed that the pyramid would grant him immortality, and he spared no expense in its construction.\n\nThe empire was in decline, and the people suffered under the emperor's rule. They were forced to work long hours, and their meager wages were barely enough to sustain them. The emperor cared little for their suffering, and he taxed them heavily to fund his grand project. As the pyramid rose higher and higher, the people grew more and more desperate. They knew that the emperor's madness would be their downfall, and they longed for the day when he would be overthrown. But the emperor's grip on power was too strong, and it seemed that he would never be defeated. The pyramid of skulls stood as a symbol of the empire's decay, a monument to the emperor's madness and the people's suffering."
```

The final dataset has the
